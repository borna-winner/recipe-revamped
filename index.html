              <h2>Goal Number One.</h2>
              <p>James wants you to eat more vetegables and raw foods, this is very important in modern day society where 95% of super markets food choices are not fresh, packaged garbage. Im not saying that fresh food will make you a new human, But i am saying that you are what you eat, and almost everyone is eating dead cookies and things like "fast food" which is the eptoime of terrible food choices </p>

              <h2>Goal Number Two.</h2>
              <p>James wants you to feel more energerized. To do this, his opinion is that the more food your body has to convert from dead to living, the more energy you waste. If you plant a bell peper instead of eat it, it will grow and is alive. The same can not be said about Oeros, Meat, or cereal.James does provide meals with fish in them, because fish is far too good for the common vitiam deficines in modern society to pass up even though it is dead food.(omega 3's vitiam d, potassium, not to mention super high protien content.)</p>

              <h2>Goal Number Three</h2>
              <p>Flavour and enjoyment of the meal is so important to James(hes a big guy), because of this none of the foods recommend hear are bland, or hard to eat. In fact, James thinks with the right seasonings and preparing method, you can make anything taste better than bigmacs and sundees.</p>
